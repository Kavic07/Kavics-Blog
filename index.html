        <h2>My Goals for the Next Two Years in the Tech Field</h2>
        <p>
          Some of the goals i aim to achieve over the next two years are as
          follows;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Enhance My Coding Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              I plan to improve my coding knowledge by participating in the
              <a data-testId="hngLink" href="http://hng.tech/learn"
                >HNG internship</a
              >. This program is renowned for its rigorous training and
              real-world projects, which will provide me with invaluable
              hands-on experience and enable me to work strictly and effectively
              with deadlines. I am eager to learn from industry experts and a
              community of like-minded people and grow my technical skills.
              Additionally, I plan to work with the company in the future,
              contributing to their innovative projects and furthering my
              career.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Master Advanced Frontend Technologies</h4>
            <p>
              I plan to explore and master popular frontend frameworks and
              libraries such as React, and Next.js. These tools are essential
              for building dynamic and responsive web applications. By becoming
              proficient in these technologies, I can create more efficient and
              maintainable code.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Develop and Launch Personal Projects</h4>
            <p>
              I aim to develop personal projects that solve real-world problems.
              For instance, I plan to create a project similar to
              <a data-testId="scrapeanywebLink" href="http://scrapeanyweb.site/"
                >ScrapeAnyWeb</a
              >,
              <a data-testId="keywordLink" href="http://keyword.dog/">Keyword</a
              >, and Mobile Simulator that will help to optimise content for
              search engines. These projects will not only showcase my skills
              but will also provide useful solutions to common challenges in web
              development
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Improve My Professional Development</h4>
            <p>
              Effective communication and collaboration are very crucial in a
              tech role. I will work on improving my skills through engagement
              with the open-source community on platforms like GitHub by
              participating in team projects and attending workshops. This will
              help work with diverse teams, learn from their expertise, and
              handle client interactions smoothly.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Network with Industry Professionals</h4>
            <p>
              I aim to build a strong professional network that is essential for
              my career growth. I will actively participate in tech conferences,
              hackathons, and online forums to connect with other developers and
              industry leaders. Networking not only opens up new opportunities
              but also provides a platform to share knowledge and experiences
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Stay Updated with Industry Trends</h4>
            <p>
              The tech field is ever-evolving. I will stay updated with the
              latest trends and best practices by following industry blogs,
              attending webinars, and enrolling in online courses. This
              continuous learning approach will ensure that my skills remain
              relevant and up-to-date.
